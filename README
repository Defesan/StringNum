Class StringNum
Version 1.0
Written by Jake Hopkins

"Brushing the dust off"

This is an exceedingly simple class that I used to flex my dormant
programming muscles. If you actually have a use for it... Well, good 
for you. The primary use, I'd imagine, would be in text formatting.

StringNum is a Singleton class, and as such, you should not attempt to
create a new instance of it. Instead, place the following line in global
space:

StringNum* StringNum::sRef == 0;

This will initialize the class' static refrence pointer.

The class has a single method, currently: string toDescriptive(long num)
This method takes a long int, and converts it to a 'descriptive', which can 
then be inserted into any string or stream as per usual. This descriptive 
is a text representation of the number as it would be spoken aloud.

To get this string, you have to ask the class for its instance.
Example:
	string desc = StringNum::instance()->toDescriptive(num);

And that's about all you need to know!
